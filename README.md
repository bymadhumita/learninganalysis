Data-driven decision-making is key to understanding business performance. I recently conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on an e-commerce sales dataset using Python.

In this analysis, I:
✔️ Analyzed monthly sales and identified peak and low sales periods.
✔️ Examined sales and profit distribution across product categories and subcategories.
✔️ Evaluated customer segments to determine their impact on revenue.
✔️ Calculated the sales-to-profit ratio for better financial insights.

By leveraging Pandas, Plotly, and other Python libraries, I was able to extract meaningful insights and visualize trends effectively.

I have compiled the findings into a structured PDF report, which you can check out here. Looking forward to feedback and discussions!
